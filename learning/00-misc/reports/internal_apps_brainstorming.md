* **Bottleneck 5: Food Waste Reduction in Parks**
  * *Challenge:* Preparing too much perishable food leads to waste; too little leads to unhappy guests.
  * *LLM Project:* **"KitchenProphet"** – Predicts food demand based on hotel occupancy and park reservations, generating a "prep list" for chefs: "Prepare 20% fewer turkey legs today due to forecasted rain."

## Coca-Cola

* **Bottleneck 1: Plastic Recycling Compliance Data**
  * *Challenge:* Tracking rPET usage across 200 countries with different regulations is a data nightmare.
  * *LLM Project:* **"SustainabilityLedger"** – Scans regulatory filings and bottler reports globally to create a unified dashboard of "Recycled Material %" vs "Local Mandate," flagging markets at risk of non-compliance.
* **Bottleneck 2: Syrup Distribution Route Planning**
  * *Challenge:* Delivering heavy syrup concentrate to restaurants requires optimizing for weight and fuel.
  * *LLM Project:* **"LoadBalancer AI"** – Optimizes truck loading patterns and routes based on traffic and fuel prices, specifically handling the unique weight constraints of liquid cargo.
* **Bottleneck 3: Regulatory Labeling Updates**
  * *Challenge:* Every time a country changes sugar tax or labeling laws, artwork must change.
  * *LLM Project:* **"LabelLawyer"** – Monitors global food safety databases. When a regulation changes (e.g., "Mexico updates sugar warning seal size"), it alerts the packaging design team and highlights the specific SKUs affected.
* **Bottleneck 4: Merchandising Verification (Planograms)**
  * *Challenge:* Ensuring supermarkets display Coke products correctly is manually checked by sales reps.
  * *LLM Project:* **"ShelfSnap"** – Sales reps take a photo of the aisle; the computer vision/LLM hybrid scores the display against the contract (Planogram compliance) and drafts a report for the store manager if shelves are empty.
* **Bottleneck 5: Internal R&D Knowledge Sharing**
  * *Challenge:* Scientists might re-invent a flavor formula that was tested and failed 10 years ago.
  * *LLM Project:* **"FormulaVault"** – A semantic search engine over 100 years of internal R&D PDF reports. A scientist can ask, "Have we tested Stevia with Cherry flavor in high-humidity markets?" and get a summary of past experiments.

## Delta Air Lines

* **Bottleneck 1: Call Center Wait Times**
  * *Challenge:* During storms, hold times skyrocket as agents manually search for rebooking options.
  * *LLM Project:* **"AgentAssist Live"** – Listens to the customer call and auto-queries the flight database for the best rebooking options, presenting the agent with the "Top 3 Routes" to offer immediately.
* **Bottleneck 2: Regulatory Compliance (FAA) Updates**
  * *Challenge:* Keeping manuals updated with constant FAA airworthiness directives is critical and tedious.
  * *LLM Project:* **"ManualSync"** – Scans new FAA directives and automatically identifies which pages of the internal Delta Maintenance Manuals need updating, drafting the revision for the safety officer.
* **Bottleneck 3: Aircraft Maintenance Log Analysis**
  * *Challenge:* Identifying chronic issues in an aircraft fleet relies on reading handwritten or typed mechanic notes.
  * *LLM Project:* **"PredictiveTech Log"** – Analyzes free-text mechanic logs to spot trends. Example: "Note: 'Vibration in left strut' appearing in 4 aircraft suggests a batch defect in the landing gear dampener."
* **Bottleneck 4: Legacy IT System Uptime**
  * *Challenge:* Airline reservation systems (like TPF) are ancient; debugging them is a lost art.
  * *LLM Project:* **"Mainframe Modernizer"** – An AI assistant trained on legacy COBOL/Assembler code that helps modern developers understand what a specific block of legacy code does when an error occurs.
* **Bottleneck 5: Tarmac Delay Compliance Reporting**
  * *Challenge:* Reporting the exact timeline of a delay to the DOT to avoid fines requires merging data from pilots, gates, and ramp towers.
  * *LLM Project:* **"TimelineReconstructor"** – Ingests audio transcripts from the cockpit, gate logs, and ramp comms to construct a second-by-second timeline of a delay event for legal and compliance review.
